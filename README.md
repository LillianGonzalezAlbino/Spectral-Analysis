# Phenotype Response to Higher Order Gene Interactions
## A Spectral Analysis Approach  
In this notebook we implement a spectral analysis on a genomic dataset with the means to analize higher order mutation interactions. The code is generalized for any dataset of similar structure with any measurable phenotype response, but we will be focusing on Hemoglobin response and thirteen mutations that were hand-picked by Dr. Emilia Huertas-Sánchez and her lab. This research started as a project for the MSRI Undergraduate Program that took place from June to July 2018 at the University of Berkeley, California.
